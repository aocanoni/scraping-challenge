UCI Data Analytics Bootcamp Module 11 Challenge- Scraping

The 'Starter_Code' folder contains all the necessary files for the completion of this challenge.

- There includes 3 files- 'part_1_mars_news.ipynb', and 'part_2_mars_weather.ipynb', 'mars_weather_data.csv'.
- 'part_1_mars_news.ipynb' is my jupyter notebook that contains the entirety of my answer to part 1 of the challenge.
- 'part_2_mars_weather.ipynb' is my jupyter notebook that contains the entirety of my answer to part 2 of the challenge. I combined some of my results within this notebook with sentences I created to fully answer the questions asked within the assignment. 
- 'mars_weather_data.csv' is the csv file that was exported from the DataFrame made within 'part_2_mars_weather.ipynb',

***All the code within this repository is solely my own work, provided through the module challenge's starter_code, or made with the assistance of the UCI Bootcamp's Xpert Learning Assistant.
